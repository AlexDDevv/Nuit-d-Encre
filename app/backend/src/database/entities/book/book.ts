 * - `user`: user who added the book (foreign key).
 * - `createdAt`: timestamp when the book was created.
 * - `updatedAt`: timestamp when the book was last updated.
 *

 * ```typescript
 * const book = new Book();
 * book.title = "The Little Prince";
 * book.description = "A poetic and philosophical tale";
 * book.author = "Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry";
 * book.isbn13 = "9780156012195";
 * book.format = "paperback";
 * book.user = userInstance;
 * book.category = categoryInstance;
 * await book.save();
 * ```
 *
 * Decorators used:
 * - `@Entity()`: Declares the class as a database entity.
 * - `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn()`: Auto-generates a primary key.
 * - `@Column()`: Maps properties to database columns.
 * - `@ManyToOne()`: Defines many-to-one relationships.
 * - `@Field()`: Exposes fields to the GraphQL schema.
